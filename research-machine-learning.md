    <h1>Machine Learning & Reinforcement Learning</h1>
    <p>We live in a world shaped by artificial intelligence. In both the quantum world and the classical world, we study and apply machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques to better understand complex systems, optimize behaviors, and solve challenging problems.</p>
    
    <h2>Inverse Design</h2>
    <p>We also explore <strong>Inverse Design</strong> methods to discover novel optical structures and quantum control sequences that meet specific performance criteria, leveraging gradient-based optimization and deep learning.</p>
